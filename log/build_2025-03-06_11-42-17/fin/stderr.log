[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findusb_servo.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "usb_servo", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "usb_servo" with
  any of the following names:

    usb_servoConfig.cmake
    usb_servo-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "usb_servo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "usb_servo_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "usb_servo" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
